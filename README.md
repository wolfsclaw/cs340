<b>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</b><BR>
<BR>
Writing a code with a modular ideal is very useful for maintainability and readability.  As an example, instead of creating a monolithic block of code, containing all the functions, classes, and main, it is better
to organize all these files into seperate classes.  Each of these files can can contain all the necessary files that are needed, such as the class, the getter, and the setter commands.  The main file would be its
its own file.  All the helper fuctions can be orgranized into libraries which help to sort the information better.<BR>

<b>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</b><BR>
<BR>
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist requires a structured and methodical process to ensure a clear understanding of the requirements, the development of an efficient solution, and effective implementation.   With regards to Grazioso Salvare's requirements and needs, I approached it by identiftying and defining the objective by understanding the client's needs, such as tracking rescue animal data, managing inventory, and generating insights for decision-making.  We gathered the requirements by engaging with stakeholders to clarify what features are necessary, such as reporting capabilities, user interfaces, and specific data relationships.  We also prioritize features by working with the client to rank the importance of different functionalities to focus on critical aspects first.  This project required understanding real-world issues, which often differ from hypothetical scenarios presented in coursework assignments.  For future project I would concentrate on the requirement by holding in-depth sessions with clients to uncover hidden needs.  I would create quick prototypes to confirm understanding before full development.  I would adopt agile methodologies to iterate quickly and incorporate feedback.  I would also use tools for data integration and process to handle complex client data needs.  I would also design systems with scalability and flexibility for future growth.<BR>

<b>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</b><BR>
<BR>
Computer scientists design, analyze, and implement algorithms and systems to solve complex problems, automate processes, and improve efficiency in various domains.  Their work is essential because it enables innovation, supports desision-making, and drives advancements in technology.  This helps Grazioso Salvare by managing large amounts of data, and making data-driven decisions.  A good database and dashboard system can improve efficiency, enhance decision-making, increase transparency and accountability, and facilitate scalability.  By delivering a tailored, efficient, and reliable system, I help Grazioso Salvare to focus on their core mission of rescuting and rehabilitating animals while reducting the burden of operational tasks.  This type of work enhances their ability to make an impact in their field.
